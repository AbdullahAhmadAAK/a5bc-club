# Website for Askari 5 Badminton Club -- Lahore

I was free during the time the Corona virus struck the Earth, so redeployed this project. I had built this during my first web development internship at [Smart Technology House - Lahore](https://www.linkedin.com/company/smart-technology-house). My mentors told me to go learn CSS, and instead of just following the restaurant website's tutorial exactly as it was, I decided to play around.

This here is the result of my 'playing around.'

If you want to take a look at the Facebook page for our club, you can see it right [here](https://www.facebook.com/AskariSmashers/).
The website is deployed [here](https://askari-5-badminton-club.vercel.app/).
